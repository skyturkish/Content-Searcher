# Content Searcher

### Motivation 
It's normal for a person to be curious about someone's opinion, especially about a topic, but if this person's idea has spread to hundreds of videos, it becomes difficult to find what they are looking for. And when people want to get these ideas as quickly as possible, a [discord bot](https://github.com/skyturkish/Content-HelperBot) may not be enough. This project will allow you to search among the topics you are curious about and bring the relevant video to you along with the time stamp of the video.

### Overview
A website where you can search among the questions that have been asked among the videos on Armağan Amcalar's youtube channel, And you can get the video along with the time stamp of the video.
